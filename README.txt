The Section block displays the contents of a section as a block. The section can be from an entirely different course.

By default, this block displays section 0 of the course it is in.

Users with the "block/section:editsections" capability can change the displayed section. (admins and managers by default)

Users with the "block/section:editcourses" capability can change the course the section is pulled from. (admins and managers by default)

Teachers cannot edit displayed sections or items unless they already have those rights in the course of origin.

Students can click on the displayed resources and activities. If they are already enrolled in the displayed section's course, they are taken to the resource or activity. If they are not enrolled, they are prompted to enroll.

Inspired by the Social Activities and Main Menu blocks.
